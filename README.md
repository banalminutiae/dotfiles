# dotfiles

Personal Configuration files and preferred defaults for the sake of convenience and productivity

Near vanilla install of emacs and some packages for personal use, including a custom theme and some custom key commands.

Usage: Linux/MacOS: git clone into home directory. If only a subdirectory of the entire config is desired, git clone into your own ~/.emacs.d directory instead.

Windows: git clone the directory under "C:\Users<username\AppData\Roaming"
